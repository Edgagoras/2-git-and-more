    "##Chapter 1  The way of the program\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The single most important skill for a computer scientist is _problem solving_. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called, “The way of the program”.\n",
    "\n",
    "On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1  What is a program?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. \n",
    "The computation might be:\n",
    "* something mathematical(solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial)\n",
    "* a symbolic computation (searching and replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or playing a video)\n",
    "\n",
    "The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:\n",
    "\n",
    "**input:**\n",
    "Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device.\n",
    "**output:**\n",
    "Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network, etc.\n",
    "**math:**\n",
    "Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.\n",
    "**conditional execution:**\n",
    "Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.\n",
    "**repetition:**\n",
    "Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\n",
    "__Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it.__ \n",
    "__So you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2  Running Python\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are a number of web pages you can use to run Python. If you already have a favorite, go ahead and use it. Otherwise I recommend PythonAnywhere. I provide detailed instructions for getting started at http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are two versions of Python, called Python 2 and Python 3. They are very similar, so if you learn one, it is easy to switch to the other. In fact, there are only a few differences you will encounter as a beginner. This book is written for Python 3, but I include some notes about Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Python interpreter** is a program that _reads and executes_ Python code. Depending on your environment, you might start the interpreter by clicking on an icon, or by typing **python** on a command line. When it starts, you should see output like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> python\n",
    "Python 3.4.0 (default, Jun 19 2015, 14:20:21) \n",
    "[GCC 4.8.2] on linux\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",
    "The first three lines contain information about the interpreter and the operating system it’s running on, so it might be different for you. But you should check that the version number, which is 3.4.0 in this example, begins with 3, which indicates that you are running Python 3. If it begins with 2, you are running (you guessed it) Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line **```** is a prompt that indicates that the interpreter is ready for you to enter code. If you type a line of code and hit Enter, the interpreter displays the result:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> 1 + 1\n",
    "2\n",
    "\n",
    "But, __python__ command didn't give a version, so I did.\n",
    "```\n",
    "> python -V\n",
    "Python 2.7.14 :: Anaconda, Inc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you’re ready to get started. From here on, I assume that you know how to start the Python interpreter and run code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###1.3  The first program\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the first program you write in a new language is called “Hello, World!” because all it does is display the words “Hello, World!”. In Python, it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print('Hello, World!')\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "* The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be displayed; they don’t appear in the result.\n",
    "* The parentheses indicate that print is a function. We’ll get to functions in Chapter 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 2, the print statement is slightly different; it is not a function, so it doesn’t use parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "This distinction will make more sense soon, but that’s enough to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4  Arithmetic operators\n",
    "\n",
    "After “Hello, World”, the next step is **arithmetic**. Python provides **operators**, which are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators +, -, and * perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, as in the following examples:\n",

    "### 1.5  Values and types\n",
    "\n",
    "A **value** is one of the basic things a program works with, like a **letter or a number**. Some values we have seen so far are 2, 42.0, and 'Hello, World!'.\n",
    "\n",
    "These values belong to different types: 2 is an **integer**, 42.0 is a **floating-point number**, and 'Hello, World!' is a **string**, so-called because **the letters it contains are strung together**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> type(2)\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    ">>> type(42.0)\n",
    "<class 'float'>\n",
    ">>> type('Hello, World!')\n",
    "<class 'str'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* In these results, the word “class” is used in the sense of a **category**; a type is a **category of values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * integers = type int\n",
    "    * strings = str\n",
    "    * floating-point numbers = float\n",
    "\n",
    "* What about values like '2' and '42.0'? They look like numbers, but they are in **quotation marks** like **strings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> type('2')\n",
    "<class 'str'>\n",
    ">>> type('42.0')\n",
    "<class 'str'>\n",
    "They’re strings.\n",

    "* Use commas between groups of digits, as in 1,000,000 is **not** a legal integer in Python, but it is legal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 1,000,000\n",
    "(1, 0, 0)\n",
    "That’s not what we expected at all! Python interprets 1,000,000 as a **comma-separated sequence of integers**. We’ll learn more about this kind of sequence later.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6  Formal and natural languages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Natural languages are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and Japanese. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); **they evolved naturally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to **express computations**. Formal languages tend to have strict syntax rules that govern the structure of statements. For example, in mathematics the statement 3 + 3 = 6 has correct syntax, but 3 + = 3 $ 6 does not. In chemistry H2O is a syntactically correct formula, but 2Zz is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to **tokens** and **structure**. **Tokens are the basic elements of the language**(words, numbers, and chemical elements). One of the problems with 3 += 3 $ 6 is that $ is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I know). Similarly, 2Zz is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second type of syntax rule pertains to **the way tokens are combined**. The equation 3 += 3 is illegal because even though + and = are legal tokens, you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is @ well-structured Engli$h sentence with invalid t*kens in it. This sentence all valid tokens has, but invalid structure with.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out the **structure** (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called *parsing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Although formal and natural languages have many features in common—tokens, structure, and syntax—there are some differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ambiguity:**\n",
    "Natural languages are full of **ambiguity**, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**redundancy:**\n",
    "In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, **natural languages employ lots of redundancy**. As a result, they are often verbose. **Formal languages are less redundant and more concise**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**literalness:**\n",
    "Natural languages are full of **idiom and metaphor**. If I say, “The penny dropped”, there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that someone understood something after a period of confusion). **Formal languages mean exactly what they say**.\n",
    "Because we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes hard to adjust to formal languages. The difference between formal and natural language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poetry:**\n",
    "Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prose:**\n",
    "The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programs:**\n",
    "The meaning of a **computer program** is **unambiguous and literal**, and can be understood entirely by **analysis of the tokens and structure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Formal languages are more **dense** than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is important, so it is not always best to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to **parse** the program in your head, **identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure**. \n",
    "* Finally, the details matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7  Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programmers make mistakes**. For whimsical reasons, **programming errors** are called **bugs** and the **process of tracking them down** is called **debugging**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong emotions. If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent, or embarrassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if they were people. When they work well, we think of them as teammates, and when they are obstinate or rude, we respond to them the same way we respond to rude, obstinate people (Reeves and Nass, The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media Like Real People and Places).\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them. \n",
    "**One approach is to think of the computer as an employee with certain strengths**, like speed and precision, and particular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability to grasp the big picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses. And find ways to use your emotions to engage with the problem, without letting your reactions interfere with your ability to work effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful for many activities beyond programming. At the end of each chapter there is a section, like this one, with my suggestions for debugging. I hope they help!\n",

    "# Chapter 2  Variables, expressions and statements\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A **variable** is a name that refers to a **value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1  Assignment statements\n",
    "\n",
    "An assignment statement creates a new variable and gives it a value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> message = 'And now for something completely different'\n",
    ">>> n = 17\n",
    ">>> pi = 3.141592653589793\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named **message**; the second gives the integer 17 to **n**; the third assigns the (approximate) value of π to **pi**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to its value. This kind of figure is called a **state diagram** because it shows what state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable’s state of mind). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2  Variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful—they document what the variable is used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable names can be as **long** as you like. \n",
    "* They can contain both **letters and numbers**, but **they can’t begin with a number**. \n",
    "* It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is **conventional to use only lower case** for variables names.\n",
    "* The underscore character, _, can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as your_name or airspeed_of_unladen_swallow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 76trombones = 'big parade'\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "__76trombones is illegal because it begins with a number__\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> more@ = 1000000\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "__more@ is illegal because it contains an illegal character, @.__\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "__It turns out that class is one of Python’s keywords. The interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable names.__\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 has these keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "False      class      finally    is         return\n",
    "None       continue   for        lambda     try\n",
    "True       def        from       nonlocal   while\n",
    "and        del        global     not        with\n",
    "as         elif       if         or         yield\n",
    "assert     else       import     pass\n",
    "break      except     in         raise\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t have to memorize this list. In most development environments, keywords are displayed in a different color; if you try to use one as a variable name, you’ll know.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3  Expressions and statements\n",
    "\n",
    "An **expression** is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 42\n",
    "42\n",
    ">>> n\n",
    "17\n",
    ">>> n + 25\n",
    "42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type an expression at the prompt, the interpreter evaluates it, which means that it finds **the value of the expression**. In this example, n has the value 17 and n + 25 has the value 42.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement is **a unit of code that has an effect**, like creating a variable or displaying a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> n = 17\n",
    ">>> print(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is an **assignment statement** that gives a value to n. The second line is a **print statement** that displays the value of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type a **statement**, the **interpreter** executes it, which means that it does whatever the statement says. In general, statements don’t have values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4  Script mode\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have run Python in interactive mode, which means that you interact directly with the interpreter. Interactive mode is a good way to get started, but if you are working with more than a few lines of code, it can be clumsy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative is to save code in a file called a **script** and then run the interpreter in script mode to execute the script. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with **.py.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know how to create and run a script on your computer, you are ready to go. Otherwise I recommend using PythonAnywhere again. I have posted instructions for running in script mode at http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Python provides both modes, you can test bits of code in interactive mode before you put them in a script. But there are differences between interactive mode and script mode that can be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are using Python as a calculator, you might type\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> miles = 26.2\n",
    ">>> miles * 1.61\n",
    "42.182\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line **assigns** a value to miles, but it has no visible effect. \n",
    "The second line is an **expression**, so the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result. It turns out that a marathon is about 42 kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you type the same code into a script and run it, you get no output at all. In script mode an expression, all by itself, has no visible effect. Python actually evaluates the expression, **but it doesn’t display the value unless you tell it to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "miles = 26.2\n",
    "print(miles * 1.61)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This behavior can be confusing at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the script\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(1)\n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "produces the output\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "The assignment statement produces no output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check your understanding, type the following statements in the Python interpreter and see what they do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "5\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "x + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now put the same statements in a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script by transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5  Order of operations\n",
    "\n",
    "When an expression contains more than one operator, the order of evaluation depends on the order of operations. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The **acronym PEMDAS** is a useful way to remember the rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parentheses** have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, 2 * (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even if it doesn’t change the result.\n",
    "* **Exponentiation** has the next highest precedence, so 1 + 2**3 is 9, not 27, and 2 * 3**2 is 18, not 36.\n",
    "* **Multiplication** and Division have higher precedence than Addition and Subtraction. So 2*3-1 is 5, not 4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5.\n",
    "* **Operators** with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponentiation). So in the expression degrees / 2 * pi, the division happens first and the result is multiplied by pi. To divide by 2 π, you can use parentheses or write degrees / 2 / pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6  String operations\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you can’t perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look like numbers, so the following are illegal:\n",
    "\n",
    "'2'-'1'    'eggs'/'easy'    'third'*'a charm'\n",
    "**But there are two exceptions, + and *.  **\n",
    "\n",
    "The + operator performs string concatenation, which means it joins the strings by linking them end-to-end. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> first = 'throat'\n",
    ">>> second = 'warbler'\n",
    ">>> first + second\n",
    "throatwarbler\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The * operator also works on strings**; it performs repetition. \n",
    "For example, 'Spam'*3 is 'SpamSpamSpam'. \n",
    "If one of the values is a string, the other has to be an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This use of + and * makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as 4*3 is equivalent to 4+4+4, we expect 'Spam'*3 to be the same as 'Spam'+'Spam'+'Spam', and it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.7  Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, it is a good idea to add **notes** to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "These notes are called comments, and they start with the # symbol:\n",
    "\n",
    "# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed\n",
    "``\n",
    "percentage = (minute * 100) / 60\n",
    "``\n",
    "In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. You can also put comments at the end of a line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "percentage = (minute * 100) / 60     # percentage of an hour\n",
    "```\n",
    "Everything from the # to the end of the line is ignored—it has no effect on the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This comment is redundant with the code and useless:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "v = 5     # assign 5 to v\n",
    "This comment contains useful information that is not in the code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "v = 5     # velocity in meters/second. \n",
    "Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is a tradeoff.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.8  Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: \n",
    "1. syntax errors\n",
    "2. runtime errors\n",
    "3. semantic errors\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax error:**\n",
    "* “Syntax” refers to the **structure** of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so (1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is a syntax error.\n",
    "* If there is a syntax error anywhere in your program, Python displays an error message and quits, and you will not be able to run the program. \n",
    "* During the first few weeks of your programming career, you might spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime error:**\n",
    "* The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until after the program has started running. \n",
    "* These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.\n",
    "* Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic error:**\n",
    "* The third type of error is “semantic”, which means related to \"meaning\". \n",
    "* If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run without generating error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.\n",
    "** Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.\n",

    "## Chapter 3  Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1  Function calls\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen one example of a function call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> type(42)\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    "The name of the function is type. The expression in parentheses is called the argument of the function. The result, for this function, is the type of the argument.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result. The result is also called the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides functions that convert values from one type to another. The int function takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> int('32')\n",
    "32\n",
    ">>> int('Hello')\n",
    "ValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello\n",
    "int can convert floating-point values to integers, but it doesn’t round off; it chops off the fraction part:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> int(3.99999)\n",
    "3\n",
    ">>> int(-2.3)\n",
    "-2\n",
    "float converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> float(32)\n",
    "32.0\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> float('3.14159')\n",
    "3.14159\n",
    "Finally, str converts its argument to a string:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> str(32)\n",
    "'32'\n",
    ">>> str(3.14159)\n",
    "'3.14159'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2  Math functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a math module that **provides most of the familiar mathematical functions**. A module is a file that contains a collection of related functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can use the functions in a module, **we have to import it with an import statement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**>>> import math**\n",
    "This statement creates a module object named math. If you display the module object, you get some information about it:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> math\n",
    "<module 'math' (built-in)>\n",
    "e.g. <module 'math' from '/Users/teachinghouse/miniconda/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/math.so'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the module. To access one of the functions, **you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called dot notation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. math.log10  nameofmodule.nameoffunction\n",
    ">>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power\n",
    ">>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example uses math.log10 to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming that signal_power and noise_power are defined). The math module also provides log, which computes logarithms base e.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> radians = 0.7\n",
    ">>> height = math.sin(radians)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second example finds the sine of radians. The name of the variable is a hint that sin and the other trigonometric functions (cos, tan, etc.) take arguments in radians. To convert from degrees to radians, divide by 180 and multiply by π:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> degrees = 45\n",
    ">>> radians = degrees / 180.0 * math.pi\n",
    ">>> math.sin(radians)\n",
    "0.707106781187\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression **math.pi** gets the variable pi from the math module. Its value is a floating-point approximation of π, accurate to about 15 digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know trigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to the square root of two divided by two:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> math.sqrt(2) / 2.0\n",
    "0.707106781187\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3  Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have looked at the elements of a program—variables, expressions, and statements—in isolation, without talking about **how to combine them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and compose them. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the argument of a function can be any kind of expression, including arithmetic operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi)\n",
    "\n",
    "And even function calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = math.exp(math.log(x+1))\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary expression, with one exception: the left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name. Any other expression on the left side is a syntax error (we will see exceptions to this rule later).\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> minutes = hours * 60                 # right\n",
    ">>> hours * 60 = minutes                 # wrong!\n",
    "SyntaxError: can't assign to operator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4  Adding new functions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible to add new functions. A **function** definition specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that run when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_lyrics():\n",
    "    print(\"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\")  #definning the header\n",
    "    print(\"I sleep all night and I work all day.\") #definninf the body\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **def** is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition. The **name of the function** is print_lyrics. \n",
    "* The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and underscore are legal, but the first character can’t be a number. You can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.\n",
    "* The **empty parentheses** after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any arguments.\n",
    "* The **first line** of the function definition is called **the header**; **the rest** is called **the body**. The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, indentation is always four spaces. The body can contain any number of statements.\n",
    "* The strings in the print statements are enclosed in **double quotes**. **Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing**; most people use single quotes except in cases like this where a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.\n",
    "* All quotation marks (single and double) must be “straight quotes”, usually located next to Enter on the keyboard. “Curly quotes”, like the ones in this sentence, are not legal in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints dots (...) to let you know that the definition isn’t complete:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> def print_lyrics():\n",
    "...     print(\"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\")\n",
    "...     print(\"I sleep all night and I work all day.\")\n",
    "...\n",
    "To end the function, **you have to enter an empty line**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a function creates a function object, which has type function:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print(print_lyrics)\n",
    "<function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c>\n",
    ">>> type(print_lyrics)\n",
    "<class 'function'>\n",
    "The syntax for calling the new function is the same as for built-in functions:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print_lyrics()\n",
    "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\n",
    "I sleep all night and I work all day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have defined a function, you can use it **inside another function**. For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write a function called repeat_lyrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "def repeat_lyrics():\n",
    "    print_lyrics()\n",
    "    print_lyrics()\n",
    "And then call repeat_lyrics:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> repeat_lyrics()\n",
    "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\n",
    "I sleep all night and I work all day.\n",
    "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\n",
    "I sleep all night and I work all day.\n",
    "But that’s not really how the song goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5  Definitions and uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the whole program looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_lyrics():\n",
    "    print(\"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\")\n",
    "    print(\"I sleep all night and I work all day.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def repeat_lyrics():\n",
    "    print_lyrics()\n",
    "    print_lyrics()\n",
    "\n",
    "repeat_lyrics()\n",
    "\n",
    "* This program contains two function definitions: print_lyrics and repeat_lyrics. Function definitions get executed just like other statements, but the effect is to create function objects. The statements inside the function do not run until the function is called, and the function definition generates no output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As you might expect, you have to create a function before you can run it. In other words, the function definition has to run before the function gets called.\n",
    "* As an exercise, move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call appears before the definitions. Run the program and see what error message you get."

    "\n",
    "* Execution always begins at the **first statement** of the program. Statements are run one at a time, in order from top to bottom.\n",
    "* Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function don’t run until the function is called.\n",
    "* A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of the function, runs the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.\n",
    "* That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to run the statements in another function. Then, while running that new function, the program might have to run yet another function!\n",
    "* Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.\n",

    "* To keep track of which variables can be used where, it is sometimes useful to draw a **stack diagram**. \n",
    "* Like state diagrams, **stack diagrams** show the value of each variable, but they also show the function each variable belongs to.\n",
    "* Each function is represented by a **frame**. A **frame** is a box with the name of a function beside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it. The stack diagram for the previous example is shown in [Figure 3.1](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2004.html).\n",
    "* The frames are arranged in a stack that indicates which function called which, and so on. In this example, print_twice was called by cat_twice, and cat_twice was called by __main__, which is a special name for the topmost frame. When you create a variable **outside** of any function, it belongs to __main__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Each parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding argument. So, part1 has the same value as line1, part2 has the same value as line2, and bruce has the same value as cat.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the name of the function, the name of the function that called it, and the name of the function that called that, all the way back to __main__.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you try to access cat from within print_twice, you get a NameError:\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 3.11  Why functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There are several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.\n",
    "    * Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
    "    * Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\n",
    "    *Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.12  Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In some ways debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four)\n",
    "\n",
    "* For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a working program and make small modifications, debugging them as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Linux is an operating system that contains millions of lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip.

    "\n",
    "1. Write a function called square that takes a parameter named t, which is a turtle. It should use the turtle to draw a square.\n",
    "Write a function call that passes bob as an argument to square, and then run the program again.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add another parameter, named length, to square. Modify the body so length of the sides is length, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run the program again. Test your program with a range of values for length.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a copy of square and change the name to polygon. Add another parameter named n and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon. Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360/n degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a function called circle that takes a turtle, t, and radius, r, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by calling polygon with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of r.\n",
    "Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that length * n = circumference.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make a more general version of circle called arc that takes an additional parameter angle, which determines what fraction of a circle to draw. angle is in units of degrees, so when angle=360, arc should draw a complete circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4  Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercise asks you to put your square-drawing code into a function definition and then call the function, passing the turtle as a parameter. Here is a solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def square(t):\n",
    "    for i in range(4):\n",
    "        t.fd(100)\n",
    "        t.lt(90)\n",
    "square(bob)\n",
    "\n",
    "#\"i\" will do __t.fd(100)__and __t.lt(90)__ once. range(4) means repeat \"i\" 4 times. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The innermost statements, fd and lt are indented twice to show that they are inside the **for loop**, which is inside the function definition (function is \"square\", indented part is called the function defenition. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The next line, square(bob), is flush with the left margin, which indicates the end of both the for loop and the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inside the function, t refers to the same turtle bob, so t.lt(90) has the same effect as bob.lt(90). In that case, why not call the parameter bob? **The idea is that t can be any turtle, not just bob**, so you could create a second turtle named alice and pass it as an argument to square:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "alice = turtle.Turtle()\n",
    "square(alice)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called **encapsulation**. \n",
    "Benefits of encapsulation:\n",
    "1. encapsulation attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documentation. \n",
    "2. Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, **it is more concise to call a function twice than to copy and paste the body!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5  Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to add a **length** parameter to square. Here is a solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def square(t, length):\n",
    "    for i in range(4):\n",
    "        t.fd(length)\n",
    "        t.lt(90)\n",
    "\n",
    "square(bob, 100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding a parameter to a function is called **generalization** because **it makes the function more general**: in the previous version, the square is always the same size; in this version it can be **any size**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The next step is also a generalization. Instead of drawing squares, polygon draws regular polygons with any number of sides. Here is a solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def polygon(t, n, length):\n",
    "    angle = 360 / n\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        t.fd(length)\n",
    "        t.lt(angle)\n",
    "\n",
    "polygon(bob, 7, 70)\n",
    "```\n",
    "polygon(bob, 6, 70)\n",
    "\n",
    "This example draws a 7-sided polygon with side length 70.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you are using Python 2, the value of angle might be off because of integer division. A simple solution is to compute angle = 360.0 / n. Because the numerator is a floating-point number, the result is floating point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When a function has more than a few numeric arguments, it is easy to forget what they are, or what order they should be in. In that case it is often a good idea to include the names of the parameters in the argument list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "polygon(bob, n=7, length=70)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are called keyword arguments because they include the parameter names as “keywords” (not to be confused with Python keywords like while and def).\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax makes the program more readable. It is also a reminder about how arguments and parameters work: when you call a function, the arguments are assigned to the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.6  Interface design\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to write circle, which takes a radius, r, as a parameter. Here is a simple solution that uses polygon to draw a 50-sided polygon:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "def circle(t, r):\n",
    "    circumference = 2 * math.pi * r\n",
    "    n = 50\n",
    "    length = circumference / n\n",
    "    polygon(t, n, length)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first line computes the circumference of a circle with radius r using the formula 2 π r. Since we use math.pi, we have to import math. By convention, import statements are usually at the beginning of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "* n is the number of line segments in our approximation of a circle, so length is the length of each segment. Thus, polygon draws a 50-sided polygon that approximates a circle with radius r.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One limitation of this solution is that n is a constant, which means that for very big circles, the line segments are too long, and for small circles, we waste time drawing very small segments. One solution would be to generalize the function by taking n as a parameter. This would give the user (whoever calls circle) more control, but the interface would be less clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The interface of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters? What does the function do? And what is the return value? An interface is “clean” if it allows the caller to do what they want without dealing with unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this example, r belongs in the interface because it specifies the circle to be drawn. n is less appropriate because it pertains to the details of how the circle should be rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rather than clutter up the interface, it is better to choose an appropriate value of n depending on circumference:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def circle(t, r):\n",
    "    circumference = 2 * math.pi * r\n",
    "    n = int(circumference / 3) + 3\n",
    "    length = circumference / n\n",
    "    polygon(t, n, length)\n",
    "```\n",
    "circle(bob, 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now the number of segments is an integer near circumference/3, so the length of each segment is approximately 3, which is small enough that the circles look good, but big enough to be efficient, and acceptable for any size circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding 3 to n guarantees that the polygon has at least 3 sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.7  Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "* **When I wrote circle, I was able to re-use polygon because a many-sided polygon is a good approximation of a circle**. But arc is **not as cooperative**; **we can’t use polygon or circle to draw an arc**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One alternative is to start with a copy of polygon and transform it into arc. The result might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def arc(t, r, angle):\n",
    "    arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360\n",
    "    n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1\n",
    "    step_length = arc_length / n\n",
    "    step_angle = angle / n\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        t.fd(step_length)\n",
    "        t.lt(step_angle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The second half of this function looks like polygon, but we can’t re-use polygon without changing the interface. We could generalize polygon to take an angle as a third argument, but then polygon would no longer be an appropriate name! Instead, let’s call the more general function polyline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def polyline(t, n, length, angle):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        t.fd(length)\n",
    "        t.lt(angle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we can rewrite polygon and arc to use polyline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def polygon(t, n, length):\n",
    "    angle = 360.0 / n\n",
    "    polyline(t, n, length, angle)\n",
    "\n",
    "def arc(t, r, angle):\n",
    "    arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360\n",
    "    n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1\n",
    "    step_length = arc_length / n\n",
    "    step_angle = float(angle) / n\n",
    "    polyline(t, n, step_length, step_angle)\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can rewrite circle to use arc:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def circle(t, r):\n",
    "    arc(t, r, 360)\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This process—rearranging a program to improve interfaces and facilitate code re-use—is called refactoring. In this case, we noticed that there was similar code in arc and polygon, so we “factored it out” into polyline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we had planned ahead, we might have written polyline first and avoided refactoring, but often you don’t know enough at the beginning of a project to design all the interfaces. Once you start coding, you understand the problem better. Sometimes refactoring is a sign that you have learned something.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.8  A development plan\n",
    "\n",
    "* A development plan is a process for writing programs. The process we used in this case study is “encapsulation and generalization”. The steps of this process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.\n",
    "2. Once you get the program working, identify a coherent piece of it, encapsulate the piece in a function and give it a name.\n",
    "3. Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 1–3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging).\n",
    "5. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example, if you have similar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately general function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This process has some drawbacks—we will see alternatives later—but it can be useful if you don’t know ahead of time how to divide the program into functions. This approach lets you design as you go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.9  docstring\n",
    "\n",
    "A **docstring** is a string at the beginning of a function that ***explains the interface*** (“doc” is short for “documentation”). Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def polyline(t, n, length, angle):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Draws n line segments with the given length and\n",
    "    angle (in degrees) between them.  t is a turtle.\n",
    "    \"\"\"    \n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        t.fd(length)\n",
    "        t.lt(angle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* By convention, all docstrings are triple-quoted strings, also known as multiline strings because the triple quotes allow the string to span more than one line.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is terse, but it contains the essential information someone would need to use this function. It explains concisely what the function does (without getting into the details of how it does it). It explains what effect each parameter has on the behavior of the function and what type each parameter should be (if it is not obvious).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Writing this kind of documentation is an important part of interface design. A well-designed interface should be simple to explain; if you have a hard time explaining one of your functions, maybe the interface could be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.10  Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "* An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The caller agrees to provide certain parameters and the function agrees to do certain work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, polyline requires four arguments: t has to be a Turtle; n has to be an integer; length should be a positive number; and angle has to be a number, which is understood to be in degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These requirements are called preconditions because they are supposed to be true before the function starts executing. Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are postconditions. Postconditions include the intended effect of the function (like drawing line segments) and any side effects (like moving the Turtle or making other changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Preconditions** are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller violates a (properly documented!) precondition and the function doesn’t work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the preconditions are satisfied and the postconditions are not, the bug is in the function. If your pre- and postconditions are clear, they can help with debugging.\n",
